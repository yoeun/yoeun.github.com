I've tried blogging before, but always stop after a few days. This time, it's *different!*

Here's why:

0. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll): Low friction way to quickly and eaisly create a blog with support for categories, tags and pagination. I'm using [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), which adds an extra layer of convenience over standard Jekyll.
0. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/): Easily write up articles without messing around with HTML tags
0. [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/): Low friction way to host a blog, deploy new articles and update existing ones. Simply type `git push` and you're done. 
0. [Disqus](http://disqus.com/): Easily add commenting support to static websites. Widely supported commenting platform. Your visitors likely already have accounts. This comes built into JB. 
0. [More content](/archive.html): I have a lot more to talk about than the last time. 
{{HOME_PATH}}
Moral of the story: Keep it simple, silly. Make it as easy as possible to do something and it'll get done. 

Cheers
